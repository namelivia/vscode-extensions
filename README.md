# VS Code extensions

This is the list of extensions I use in VSCode. To install all of them run `sh install.sh`, to uninstall all of them run `sh uninstall.sh`.

## Extensions
1. `akamud.vscode-theme-onedark`: A Visual Studio Code extension that applies the One Dark color theme, enhancing the editor's visual appearance.

2. `github.copilot`: An AI-driven tool by GitHub that assists programmers in writing code efficiently by suggesting contextually relevant code snippets and autocompletions.

3. `github.copilot-chat`: GitHub Copilot Chat is a companion extension to GitHub Copilot that houses preview Chat features. To learn more about GitHub Copilot Chat, read our post.
